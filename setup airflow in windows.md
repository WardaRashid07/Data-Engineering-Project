Step 2: Verify Docker Installation

-- run this in powershell

# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Verify Docker is running
docker run hello-world

1. mkdir airflow-docker-project
Purpose: Creates a new directory (folder) named airflow-docker-project.

Use case: You're setting up a workspace for a project‚Äîlikely one involving Apache Airflow and Docker.

2. cd airflow-docker-project
Purpose: Changes the current working directory to the newly created airflow-docker-project folder.

Use case: After creating the folder, this command moves you inside it so you can start adding files, 
running scripts, or initializing your project.

üìÅ mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
Creates three directories:

dags: Where your Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) files go‚Äîthese define your workflows.

logs: Stores logs generated by Airflow tasks.

plugins: A place to add custom plugins to extend Airflow‚Äôs functionality.

The -p flag ensures that the command doesn‚Äôt throw an error if the directories already exist.

üîê $env:AIRFLOW_UID=50000
Sets an environment variable called AIRFLOW_UID to 50000.

This is important for Linux-based Docker containers to ensure the correct file permissions.

On Windows PowerShell, this syntax sets the variable for the current session.

On Linux/macOS, you'd use: export AIRFLOW_UID=50000.

üß± docker-compose up airflow-init
Starts up the Airflow services defined in your docker-compose.yml file.

The airflow-init service is responsible for:

Initializing the Airflow metadata database.

Creating necessary folders and permissions.

Setting up the Airflow user and default connections.
