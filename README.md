**In this project i will be building a real-time data streaming pipeline, covering each phase from data ingestion to processing and finally storage. We'll utilize a powerful stack of tools and technologies, including Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, and Cassandraâ€”all neatly containerized using Docker.**
