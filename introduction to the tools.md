# üèóÔ∏è Real-Time Data Architecture Overview

This document outlines a step-by-step architecture for a real-time data pipeline using modern open-source tools.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion ‚Äì Apache Airflow + API + PostgreSQL

- **Apache Airflow** orchestrates and automates workflows.
- It fetches data from external APIs (e.g., weather services, IoT sensors).
- Data is optionally stored in **PostgreSQL** for:
  - Historical analysis
  - Batch processing
- Airflow also streams ingested data into **Apache Kafka** for real-time processing.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Message Streaming ‚Äì Apache Kafka + Zookeeper

- **Apache Kafka** acts as a real-time data highway.
- **Zookeeper** manages Kafka brokers and ensures cluster coordination.
- **Schema Registry** enforces consistent data formats across producers and consumers.
- **Kafka Control Center** provides monitoring and management capabilities.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing ‚Äì Apache Spark

- **Apache Spark** consumes data from Kafka for real-time processing.
- Operations include:
  - Transformations
  - Aggregations
  - Filtering
- **Spark Master** coordinates distributed tasks.
- **Spark Workers** execute processing in parallel for scalability.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage ‚Äì Apache Cassandra

- Processed data is stored in **Apache Cassandra**.
- Cassandra is optimized for:
  - High-speed writes
  - Fast reads
  - Real-time analytics

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Containerization ‚Äì Docker

- All components (Airflow, Kafka, Zookeeper, Spark, Cassandra) run inside **Docker containers**.
- Benefits include:
  - Easy deployment
  - Portability across environments
  - Simplified management and scaling
